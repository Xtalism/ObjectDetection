This a YoloV8 project object detection. I used Python 3.8 to write this program.

In order to install the necessary dependencies we need to install our requirements.txt file and build our Python 3.8 virtual environment, just as follows:

    py -3.8 -m venv {namefyourvirtualenvironment}
    py -m pip install requirements.txt

If you happen to change or add new dependencies, you can also make your own requirements.txt file as follows:

    py -m pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
